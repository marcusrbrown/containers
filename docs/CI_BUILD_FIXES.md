# CI Build Issues Resolution

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Feature Branch Build Failures

**Problem**: Invalid tag format `ghcr.io/marcusrbrown/parity-branch:-812f5cf`

**Root Cause**: The `type=sha,prefix={{branch}}-` was generating empty prefixes

**Solution**: Changed to `type=sha,format=short,prefix={{branch}}-,enable={{is_default_branch}}` to limit to main branch only

### 2. Main Branch Docker Hub Failures

**Problem**: Invalid tag format `***/parity-branch:main` where `***` represents empty Docker Hub username

**Root Cause**: Docker metadata action was trying to generate Docker Hub tags even when DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME secret was not set, resulting in malformed image names

**Solution**:

- Reverted to single metadata extraction step with both registries
- Used secrets directly since Docker Hub credentials are configured
- Simplified conditional logic to avoid complex secret checking in workflow conditions

### 3. Docker Hub Authentication

**Problem**: Inconsistent secret checking logic

**Solution**: Added proper environment variable validation for DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME and DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified metadata extraction**: Back to single step with both GHCR and Docker Hub images
2. **Direct secret usage**: Using secrets directly in metadata action since they are configured
3. **Removed complex conditionals**: Simplified Docker Hub login since credentials are available
4. **Enhanced validation**: Added tag validation step with improved error detection
5. **Streamlined workflow**: Removed unnecessary tag combination logic

## Testing

The workflow now includes a validation step that checks for:

- Empty tag components (tags ending with `:` or containing `:-`)
- Proper tag format compliance

## Expected Behavior

- **Feature branches**: Will generate tags like `ghcr.io/marcusrbrown/parity-branch:feature-name`
- **Main branch**: Will generate multiple tags including `latest`, `main`, and short SHA
- **Docker Hub**: Only pushes when credentials are properly configured

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:

- Matrix validation for image name compatibility
- Automated tag cleanup for old builds
- Multi-registry sync verification
